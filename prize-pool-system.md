# Prize Pool System

#### **How It Works** <a href="#how-it-works" id="how-it-works"></a>

**Pool Funding**

* **Contribution Rate**: 0.1% of every trade volume goes to the prize pool
* **Example**: A $1,000 trade contributes $1 to the pool (0.1%)

**Fee Breakdown**: From the standard 1% trading fee:

* 0.1% goes to prize pool
* 0.9% remains as Strike's revenue

**Prize Distribution**

* **Draw Frequency**: Every Sunday at 7 PM EST
* **Winners**: One lucky trader selected randomly
* **Prize Amount**: 100% of the accumulated weekly pool
* **Reset**: Pool returns to $0 after each draw
