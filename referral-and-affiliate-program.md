# Referral & Affiliate Program

#### **How It Works** <a href="#how-it-works" id="how-it-works"></a>

**1. Referral Hierarchy**

* **Level 1 (Direct)**: Users you invite directly earn you **50%** of Strike's cut.
* **Level 2 (Indirect)**: Users invited by your Level 1 referrals earn you **10%**.

**2. Commission Calculation**

Commissions are based on **Strike's cut** (trading fees minus prize pool contribution):

**Example**:

* Trade fee: $10 → $1 to prize pool → $9 Strike's cut.
* **Your earnings**: $4.50 (50% of $9) for Level 1, $0.90 (10%) for Level 2.
