# Navigation

### Sidebar Navigation

The dashboard features a sidebar navigation system:

* **Sidebar:** Located on the left side of the screen, contains links to all major sections
* **Collapsible:** Can be collapsed by clicking the menu icon in the header
* **Mobile-Responsive:** On smaller screens, the sidebar transforms into a hamburger menu

### Main Navigation Sections

The sidebar is organized into logical sections:

1. **Dashboard** - The main overview
2. **Users** - User management features
3. **Teams** - Team management features
4. **Transactions** - Transaction tracking and management
5. **Top Users** - Leaderboards and performance tracking
6. **Referrals** - Referral program management
7. **Winners** - Weekly competition winners
8. **Settings** - System configuration options

### Navigating Between Sections

To navigate to a specific section:

1. Locate the section in the sidebar
2. Click on the section name
3. If the section has sub-items, they will expand
4. Click on the specific sub-item to access that feature

### Breadcrumb Navigation

When navigating deeper into the dashboard, a breadcrumb trail appears at the top of the content area:

* Shows your current location in the dashboard hierarchy
* Allows you to navigate back to parent sections
* Provides context for your current view

### Responsive Design

The navigation adapts to different screen sizes:

* On desktop, the full sidebar is visible
* On tablets, the sidebar can be collapsed to provide more screen space
* On mobile devices, the sidebar transforms into a hamburger menu
