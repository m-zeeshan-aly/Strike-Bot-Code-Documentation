### Authentication

All API routes (except health check) require authentication via a Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

### Health Check

```
GET /api/health
```

Returns a simple health check response to verify API is running.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "ðŸš€ API is running!"
}
```

### Error Handling

All endpoints follow a consistent error response format:

```json
{
  "error": "Descriptive error message"
}
```

HTTP status codes are used appropriately to indicate the type of error:
- 400: Bad Request (invalid input)
- 401: Unauthorized (missing or invalid token)
- 404: Not Found (resource not found)
- 409: Conflict (e.g., resource already exists)
- 500: Internal Server Error
