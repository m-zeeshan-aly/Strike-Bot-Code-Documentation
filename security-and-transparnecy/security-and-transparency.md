# Security & Transparency



**Security Measures**

**Non-Custodial Philosophy**

* **Limited Storage:** Strike Bot only holds tokens temporarily for active trading
* **User Control:** Withdraw funds to your personal wallet anytime
* **No Private Keys:** We never ask for or store seed phrases or private keys

**Transaction Security**

* **Secure Signing**: All transactions cryptographically signed
* **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attempts
* **Transaction Timeouts**: Limits exposure window for pending transactions

**Bot Infrastructure**

* **Regular Audits**: Security reviews by independent firms
* **Server Isolation**: Critical components run on isolated infrastructure
* **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit

***

#### **On-Chain Transparency** <a href="#on-chain-transparency" id="on-chain-transparency"></a>

**Blockchain Verification**

* **Public Transactions**: Every trade and withdrawal has a public TX hash
* **Solscan Links**: Verify all activity independently via blockchain explorer
* **Example**: `Transaction Complete! âœ… TX: https://solscan.io/tx/5x8J...9zL2`

**Verification Steps**

1. Receive transaction hash from bot
2. Visit Solscan.io and enter the hash
3. Confirm details match your expected transaction

**Real-time Proof**

* All token prices quoted from public liquidity pools
* Trading paths shown transparently
* Fees clearly displayed before confirmation

***

#### **Fee Transparency** <a href="#fee-transparency" id="fee-transparency"></a>

**Clear Fee Structure**

**Trading Fee**: 1% of transaction volume

* 0.1% to community prize pool
* 0.9% to Strike Bot operations
* **Network Fees**: Standard Solana transaction fees (\~0.0005 SOL)
* **No Hidden Charges**: All fees disclosed before transaction confirmation

***

#### **Best Security Practices** <a href="#best-security-practices" id="best-security-practices"></a>

**For Users**

* **Regular Withdrawals**: Transfer large balances to personal wallets
* **Address Verification**: Always double-check withdrawal addresses
* **Transaction Records**: Save TX hashes for important transactions
* **Reasonable Amounts**: Start with smaller trades until comfortable

**Red Flags to Watch For**

Strike Bot will **never** ask for:

* Your seed phrase or private keys
* Deposits to "upgrade" your account
* External website logins
* Personal information beyond Telegram

***

#### **Commitment to Security** <a href="#commitment-to-security" id="commitment-to-security"></a>

Security is an ongoing process, not a static feature. Strike Bot continuously improves security measures and welcomes community feedback. If you have suggestions or concerns, please contact us through official channels.Remember: The security of blockchain is in its transparency. If something can't be verified on-chain, question it.
